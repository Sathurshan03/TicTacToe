# TicTacToe
This is an online verison of Tic Tac Toe. 
This program was made in my early times in learning programming. Therefore, the code is very inefficient. 
At this time, my knowledge in programming included arrays, loops, and very basic coding in C#.
To see the code for this game, click TicTacToe_SathurshanA, and then click Form1.cs.
(Note: not including "Designer.cs" files)
